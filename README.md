# REMORA Spectrometer
 REMORA is an app-based spectrometer that simplifies UV-spectrometry into a simple device used on mobile that allows user to track down the water pollutant source via the analysed pollution index of the water specimen on field research.  
 
 Tech service products like Firebase Real-Time Database (Firebase Console) and Google Map API were implemented in our REMORA app. 
 
 
 These are files used for the project REMORA:
   REMORA_V8.aia is the Android app developed in MIT App Inventor, hence the aia file is required to import into MIT App Inventor for it to be opened. One can click the 'Build' button to download the code into apk, or download an MIT App Inventor companion app on mobile and connect it by simply clicking 'Connect' then 'AI Companion' to demo on the mobile. 
   Spec-redesign-Larger.SLDPRT is the 3D Printing file designed in SOLIDOWRKS for the spectrometer. 
   index_Edited_DURING FINALS.html is the embedded web app in the android app, note that this is in raw code form, hence do copy the code and paste it in any idle such as Visual Studio code and save as a HTML file to be opened in browser. 
   Remora_final.apk is the apk file of the app.
