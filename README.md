# REMORA Spectrometer
 REMORA is an app-based spectrometer that simplifies UV-spectrometry into a simple device used on mobile that allows user to track down the water pollutant source via the analysed pollution index of the water specimen on field research.  
 
 Tech service products like Firebase Real-Time Database (Firebase Console) and Google Map API were implemented in our REMORA app. 
 
 These are files used for project REMORA:
   REMORA_V8.aia is the latest MIT App Inventor file used in the apk, hence the aia file is required to import into MIT App Inventor for it to be opened. 
   Spec-redesign-Larger.SLDPRT is the 3D Print file for the physical component of this project.
